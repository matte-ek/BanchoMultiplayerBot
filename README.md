# Bancho Multiplayer Bot

Multiplayer bot for osu! written in C#, powered by [BanchoSharp](https://github.com/hburn7/BanchoSharp)

## Introduction

This bot provides auto host rotate functionality in osu! lobbies, of which I personally run 4. I started running a few lobbies back
in 2022 with other osu! bots, but wasn't happy with the features provided, thus BanchoMultiplayerBot was created.

## Libraries

* [BanchoSharp](https://github.com/hburn7/BanchoSharp) by [hburn7 (Stage)](https://github.com/hburn7) - Bancho client library used to interact with bancho
* [osu.NET](https://github.com/minisbett/osu.NET) by [minisbett](https://github.com/minisbett) - osu!api library used to interact with the osu!api
* [rosu-pp](https://github.com/MaxOhn/rosu-pp) by [MaxOhn](https://github.com/MaxOhn) - Performance point calculating library used to calculate performance points

(And also the "bigger" ones such as the ASP.NET stack, SeriLog, EntityFrameworkCore, Newtonsoft.Json, Moq, prometheus-net)
